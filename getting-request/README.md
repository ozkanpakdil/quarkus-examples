# getting-request project

Just to show how to get request in quarkus controller/resource

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using `./gradlew quarkusBuild`.
It produces the `getting-request-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `build` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/lib` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/getting-request-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, just add the `--uber-jar` option to the command line:
```
./gradlew quarkusBuild --uber-jar
```

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: `./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native`.

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: `./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true`.

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/getting-request-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
